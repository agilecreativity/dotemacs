# __target__-snippets.el

Yasnippets for [__name__](__website__).

## Installation

I highly recommend installing __target__-snippets through elpa.

It's available on [melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/):

    M-x package-install __target__-snippets

You can also install the dependencies on your own, and just dump
__target__-snippets in your path somewhere:

 - <a href="https://github.com/magnars/s.el">s.el</a>
 - <a href="https://github.com/magnars/dash.el">dash.el</a>

## Usage

TODO: Write some stuff about available snippets.

## Setup

Well, you'll have to require it. You'll also need
[yasnippets](https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet) of course.

    (require '__target__-snippets)
