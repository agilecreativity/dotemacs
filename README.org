#+TITLE: My Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Burin Choomnuan

This is my Emacs configuration based on the excellent config by [[https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d][Magnar Sveen]].
I am using [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]] as the package manager to keep
the installation clean and portable.
It has been tested on [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]] with Emacs version 24.5.1 but it should
work also on MacOs.

** Basic Installation

 - Install the [[https://cask.github.io/][Cask]]
 - See [[https://cask.github.io/usage.html][Cask usage page]] for details
