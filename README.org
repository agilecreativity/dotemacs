#+TITLE: My Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Burin Choomnuan

My new Emacs configuration, hopefully cleaner than the previous version.
Let's start from scratch and add more to this list only when required.

Make use of [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]] to keep the installation clean.

** Tips and Tricks

 - Use Org mode together with [[file:init.org][init.org]] to generate the config
 - See [[https://cask.github.io/usage.html][Cask usage page]] for details
